My Expenses - an expense tracker app


Built with NodeJS, Express,js, AngularJS and chromium (as a child process) and bootstrap for style.

Run <code>npm install</code>

Before you run, you might need to change the child process on the spawn command to fit your machine's chrome browser. Current settings fit to Linux machine (chromium-browser)(there's an open issue for this).

Run:
<code>nodejs app.js</code>
<br />

Or run it as a regular WebApp:
<code>nodejs app.js webapp</code>

You can also create a shell script with this command for your comfort.

Enjoy! And share your thoughts!
