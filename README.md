My Expenses - an expense tracker app


Built with NodeJS, Express,js, AngularJS and chromium (as a child process) and bootstrap for style.

Before you run, you might need to change the child process on the spawn command to fit your machine's chrome browser. Current settings fit to Linux machine (chromium-browser)(there's an open issue for this).

Run:
<code>nodejs path/to/myExpenses/app.js</code>
<br />

Or run it as a regular WebApp:
<code>nodejs app.js WebApp</code>

You can also create a shell script with this command for your comfort.

Enjoy! And share your thoughts!
