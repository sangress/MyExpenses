My Expenses - an expense tracker app


Built with NodeJS, Express,js, AngularJS and chromium (as a child process) and bootstrap for style.

Before you run, currently the IP address is set manually (there's an open issue for this) in app.js. And you might need to change the child process on the spawn command to fit your machine's chrome browser. Current settings fit to Linux machine (chromium-browser).

Run:
<code>nodejs path/to/myExpenses/app.js</code>
<br />

You can also create a shell script with this command for your comfort.

Enjoy! And share your thoughts!
